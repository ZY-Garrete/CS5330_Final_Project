# Research Plan in Nov
+ **1. Using blender to create datasets**
  + building and irrelevant objects
  + Collect, clean, and annotate the datasetï¼š ensure that the images contain non-relevant objects, and prepare them for use by Fast R-CNN.
  + Collect and preprocess possible test datasets for later NeRF reconstruction testing.

+ **2. Complete the reproduction of R-CNN code**
  + Idea adjustment(RCNN -> fast RCNN)
  + Training Fast R-CNN model, performing object detection task on prepared dataset, and generating masks.

+ **3. Complete the reproduction of DDPM code**
  + Idea adjustment(DDPM -> Latent DDPM)
  + Use LDMs diffusion model to perform repair test on non-related object areas, and try to fill reasonable content in the mask area.
  
+ **4. intergrate RCNN + DDOM**
  + Cooperation to integrate Fast R-CNN and diffusion model to complete the "detection-separation-repair" process and ensure that the output image is suitable for 3D reconstruction
+ **Run NeRF on the integrated image for 3D reconstruction**
  + compare the effect difference with and without non-related object repair.
+ **Fine tune and documentation**
# Onging process
+ blender -> building 
+ **Complete the reproduction of NeRF code**

# Questions and ideas
  + Relevance of the image generated by the diffusion model
    + 1
  + Completeness of the image generated by the diffusion model
    + 2
  + **About the output and data flow of nerf**
  + the data flow transfer difference in tensorflow and pytorch
